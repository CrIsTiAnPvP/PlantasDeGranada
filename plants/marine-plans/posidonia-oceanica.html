                <p><strong>Posidonia oceanica</strong> is a seagrass endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, of great ecological importance for marine ecosystems. It is found in sandy and rocky bottoms at depths of up to 40 meters, forming underwater meadows that are essential for marine biodiversity.</p>
                <p>This underwater plant plays a key role in oxygenating the water, sediment retention, and providing habitats for various marine species.</p>
