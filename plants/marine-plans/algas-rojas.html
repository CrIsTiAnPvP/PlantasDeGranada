                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>
                    Red algae are a diverse group of marine algae belonging to the class Rhodophyta.
                    They are mainly found in marine environments, although some species also exist in freshwater.
                    Red algae are one of the main sources of nutrients and habitat for many marine species.
                </p>

                <h2>Characteristics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Height:</strong> They can reach between 20 cm and 1 meter in height.</li>
                    <li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Instead of leaves, they have flat and branched structures that perform photosynthesis. They can be filamentous, laminated, or bushy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Habitat:</strong> Rocky bottoms, Posidonia meadows, and deeper areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Moderate, influenced by light, temperature, and nutrients, with a sexual and asexual life cycle.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Ecological Importance and Benefits</h2>
                <p>Red algae play a crucial role in marine ecosystems as they:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide habitats and shelter for fish, invertebrates, and other marine organisms.</li>
                    <li>Are fundamental in the formation and stabilization of coral reefs and rocky bottoms.</li>
                    <li>Contribute to the carbon cycle by fixing CO2 through photosynthesis.</li>
                    <li>Serve as a food base for many marine species.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
                <p>Red algae have multiple applications in various industries:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Food Industry:</strong> They are the source of carrageenans and agar, compounds used as thickeners and gelling agents in foods like ice cream, yogurt, and sauces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cosmetics:</strong> Extracts from red algae are used in skincare products due to their antioxidant and moisturizing properties.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pharmaceutical:</strong> Their antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer properties are under investigation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> They are used as biofertilizers due to their mineral content and bioactive compounds.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Threats and Conservation</h2>
                <p>Red algae face several threats from human activity and climate change:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Rising water temperatures and ocean acidification negatively affect their growth and reproduction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> The presence of excess nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, can cause harmful algal blooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Overharvesting:</strong> Some species are endangered due to excessive collection for industrial purposes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    It is important to protect red algae through regulations on their collection, reducing marine pollution,
                    and mitigating climate change.

                <h2>Notable Species</h2>
                <p>There are various species of red algae, but some of the most well-known include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chondrus crispus:</strong> Known as Irish moss, used in the food industry to obtain carrageenans.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gelidium:</strong> The main source of agar worldwide.</li>
                    <li><strong>Porphyra:</strong> The base of nori seaweed, used in Japanese cuisine to prepare sushi.</li>
