                <p>The cherimoya is a very nutritious fruit mainly grown in tropical regions, such as the coast of Granada and parts of Málaga. Spain is the leading producer of this fruit in Europe, and Granada is one of the main regions where it is produced. The cultivation of cherimoya has increased in recent years due to its high demand in both national and international markets.</p>

            <div> 
                <p>There are about 50 species of cherimoya, though only eight have commercial interest. They are typically identified by their color, size, and taste. The most common ones are green, gray, and red or pink, with the green ones having the sweetest and most compact flesh. It is a multiple fruit formed from several carpels of the same flower. Its skin is green, relatively fragile, and rough, with a pattern that looks like that of a reptile. The shape of the cherimoya resembles a heart, which makes it easily recognizable in markets.</p>

                <h3>Non-Edible Cherimoyas</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Annona reticulata (Reticulated Cherimoya)
                        <p>The seeds can be toxic if ingested in large quantities.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>Annona squamosa (Sugar Apple)
                        <p>The atemoya, a hybrid between cherimoya and Annona squamosa, is edible but has no significant nutritional value. The non-edible parts, such as the seeds, should be avoided.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>Annona muricata (Soursop)
                        <p>It is part of the cherimoya family. Its seeds are toxic. Only its juice can be consumed.</p>

                        <p>The classic variety that is the most common and found in many tropical and subtropical countries.</p>
