                        <p>The Jara is a plant typical of Mediterranean regions, especially in dry and sunny areas such as the coast of Granada. It is a shrub resistant to high temperatures and drought, adapting well to the poor, rocky soils that characterize this region.</p>

                    <h2>Characteristics of the Jara</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Size and Shape:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Jara is a shrub that can reach a height of between 0.5 and 2 meters, depending on the species and environmental conditions. Its structure is branched, with woody stems growing upwards and a dense, compact appearance.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Leaves:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The leaves of the Jara are small, lanceolate, and greyish-green in color. They are evergreen and covered with a fine layer of hairs that help reduce water loss. These leaves have a rough texture and are arranged alternately along the stems.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Flowers:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The flowers of the Jara are one of its most distinctive features. They are medium-sized and come in vibrant colors, ranging from white, pink, and purple. The flowers typically have a "five-petal" shape and are grouped in clusters. They are very attractive to bees and other pollinating insects.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Fruit:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The fruit of the Jara is a woody capsule that contains several seeds. As it matures, the capsule opens explosively, releasing the seeds into the environment. This mechanism is an adaptation for dispersing seeds over large areas.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
