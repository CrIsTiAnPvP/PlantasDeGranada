                <p>
                    The avocado is known for its multiple health benefits. It is an excellent source of healthy fats, mainly monounsaturated fats, 
                    which help reduce bad cholesterol (LDL) and promote cardiovascular health. It is also rich in fiber, vitamins (such as vitamin E, C, B5, B6, and K), 
                    and minerals like potassium.

                <h2>Avocado Cultivation</h2>
                <p>
                    Avocado requires a warm climate to thrive, with temperatures not dropping below 5 °C. It is ideal for well-drained, slightly acidic soils. 
                    Cultivation in Spain has expanded, especially in the Costa Tropical, where the subtropical climate favors its growth. Avocados typically bloom in spring, 
                    and the fruit takes between 6 to 9 months to mature.
