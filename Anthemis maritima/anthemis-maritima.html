            <h2>General Information</h2>
            <p>
                Anthemis maritima, commonly known as the "marine daisy," is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.
                This plant is primarily found in coastal areas of the Mediterranean, including the southern coast of Spain.
                It is known for its ability to adapt to arid and saline soils, allowing it to grow in harsh environments near the sea.

            <h2>Ecological Importance and Benefits</h2>
            <p>
                Anthemis maritima plays an important role in coastal ecosystems:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil Fixation:</strong> Helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion in coastal areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Shelter:</strong> Provides habitat for pollinating insects and small organisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Pollination:</strong> Its flowers attract bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
            <p>
                Although its use is not as widespread as other plants, Anthemis maritima has several applications:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decoration:</strong> It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Mediterranean gardens and coastal areas due to its drought resistance.</li>
                <li><strong>Medicinal Properties:</strong> Some parts of the plant have been used in traditional medicine to treat digestive issues and as an anti-inflammatory.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Education:</strong> It is used in conservation programs and awareness-raising efforts about coastal flora.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Threats and Conservation</h2>
            <p>
                Anthemis maritima faces several challenges from human activity and environmental changes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Urbanization:</strong> The construction of infrastructure in coastal areas reduces its natural habitat.</li>
                <li><strong>Tourism:</strong> Recreational activities, such as the movement of people and vehicles, can damage local populations.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Rising sea levels and extreme temperatures affect its growth and reproduction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It is crucial to protect its habitat through regulations that limit coastal urbanization and promote the restoration of dunes and natural areas.

            <h2>Curiosities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The genus name "Anthemis" comes from the Greek word "anthemon," meaning "flower."</li>
                <li>Its flowers have been used as a symbol of resilience due to their ability to thrive in poor soils and extreme conditions.</li>
                <li>In some areas, its potential for phytoremediation, i.e., the ability to clean contaminated soils, has been studied.</li>
